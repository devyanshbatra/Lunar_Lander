This code demonstrates the implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an agent to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent is designed to control a lunar lander, learning through reinforcement learning to safely land on a target platform by maximizing cumulative rewards. The environment provides a continuous state space representing the lander’s position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity, and a discrete action space of four possible thrust commands.

The DQN employs a neural network to approximate the Q-value function, mapping states to actions. The network architecture includes an input layer matching the state size, two hidden layers with 64 neurons each using ReLU activation, and an output layer representing Q-values for all possible actions. The agent uses experience replay, storing transitions (state, action, reward, next state, done) in a buffer. During training, random samples from this buffer are used to stabilize learning by breaking temporal correlations in the data. The agent employs a separate target network to further stabilize training, updated periodically using soft updates that interpolate weights between the local and target networks.

The agent interacts with the environment in a training loop of up to 2,000 episodes, using an ε-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation. Initially, the agent explores heavily (ε = 1.0), with exploration decaying over time to focus on exploitation (ε = 0.01). The training process involves optimizing the neural network using the Bellman equation, where Q-values are updated based on rewards and discounted future values.

The goal is to achieve an average score of 200 over the last 100 episodes, indicating the agent can reliably land the module. Once solved, the model is saved for future use. Additionally, the code renders and saves a
